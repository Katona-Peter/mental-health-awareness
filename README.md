This project is used by the following stakeholders:

- any person facing mental health issues
- members  of community seeking information to provide mental health support
- employers seeking advice to improve wellness at workplace for employees
- any person just interested in increasing the own mental health awareness

The scope of webpage has been developped based on the User Experience of potential stakeholders.

There are considered 6 User Stories based on concept of 3W: WHo - What - Why.

The User Stories are on the base of development of Acceptance Criterias and Tasks for the Project.

The Tasks are prioritized according to MoSCoW method in:
- Must-have: Essential requirements that are critical for project success - 3 items
- Should-have: Important but not vital features that enhance the project - 2 items
- Could-have: Desirable additions that can be included if time and resources allow - 1 item
- Wonâ€™t-have (this time): Features that are agreed to be excluded from the current scope - N/A



## Features

- The webpage follows the responsible design concept, which ensures that it adapts to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal viewing experience whether on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.

## Development of the webpage

The structure of webpage follow the structure:  
head  
body  
    navbar  
    header
    main
    footer

For elaboration of webpage there are used HTML and CSS elements and Bootstrap toolkit.
The development is carried out in VS Code IDE.  
The repositories are stored in GitHub.

For development it was used AI of VS Code co-pilot in separate window and inline variant.  
Whenever possible - like complex coding - the coding was taken over in manual coding mode.  
With assistance of AI coding it was needed special care because sometimes there were affected also codes which have not been intended.

The Readme.md file has been developped with [Readme.so](https://readme.so/editor)## Color Reference

It has been selected a palette of calming colors suggested by:
