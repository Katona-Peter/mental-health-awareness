Delivering information about mental health awareness

## Features
The webpage aims to provide for user accessible, beginner-friendly information on mental health, including how to recognize common issues and manage stress, presented in a supportive and organised layout.

The webpage starts with a Positive Message encouraging users about mental health, using a calming colour scheme and a simple background image.
The Information Cards: Use Bootstrapâ€™s card components to present mental health tips and common issues, providing a visually
 appealing way to organise content.
 Resource Links: A grid layout for external links to mental health resources styled with Bootstrap buttons to make them
 stand out.
 Positive Affirmations: Use Bootstrapâ€™s text utilities to include a section with uplifting quotes or messages to encourage
 users
